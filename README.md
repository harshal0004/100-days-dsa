Hi, my name is Harshal Dhamale. I am a software engineer with 2 years of experience, currently working in a service-based company. I am highly motivated and aspire to work with top product-based companies. To achieve this, I have started this venture to strengthen my problem-solving skills by solving problems in a pattern-wise manner. Stay tuned—I’m very excited to begin this journey!
